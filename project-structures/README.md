# Project structures

Structuring a project is not really exciting, nor is it the main focus in a project life, but it's
certainly one of the most important decision to make at the beginning of the project if you do not
want to have a massive refactoring afterwards and if you want your project to be quickly understood
and workable by other developers.

A project should be structured to:

- be consistent
- easy to understand (e.g. use common keywords, patterns)
- easy to navigate (e.g. can quickly pinpoint where to fix a bug)
- easy to change (i.e. loosely coupled)
- easy to test

## Sample project

To compare the different project structure, we will use a simple pet store project to:

- add new pets
- get a pet
- order a pet
- get an order details

## Patterns

Here are some common project structures:

- [flat structure](flat)
- [layered group by function](layered)
- [modular group by use case](modular)
- [hexagonal architecture](hexagonal)
- [clean architecture](clean)
